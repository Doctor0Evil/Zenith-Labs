# 📖 ALNFantasia Playbook

Welcome, Adventurer!
This is the Player’s Codex — the manual that guides your journey through worlds of lore, quests, dice, and community-driven creation.

## 🗺️ Directory Navigation & Commands

- `LOOT.SEARCH /path` → Finds items, relics, resources
- `BATTLE.START /World/Spy/Mission007` → Trigger battle/stealth sequence
- `PLAYER.STATS` → View character sheet & GP balance
